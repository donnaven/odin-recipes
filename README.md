# odin-recipes
   This project was made to better my understanding of basic HTML
structure. The assignment was to create a website with 3 different recipes using lists and links.

I have demonstrated:
    - the use of <a href> links,
    - the use of ordered lists,
    - the use of unordered lists,
    - and basic HTML knowledge
