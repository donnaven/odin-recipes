# odin-recipes
   This project was made to better my understanding of basic HTML
structure. The assignment was to create a website with 3 different recipes using lists and links.

I have demonstrated:
    - the use of `a href` links, <br />
    - the use of ordered lists, <br />
    - the use of unordered lists, <br />
    - and basic HTML knowledge <br />
